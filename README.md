# Seedbox Alpha üå±

Welcome to Seedbox Alpha! This is a personal, hands-on learning project designed to explore full-stack development through building a friendly desktop chatbot. Seedbox Alpha uses Local Large Language Models (LLMs) to help you write clearer, prettier code. Everything here is self-coded‚Äîno directly generated AI code, just pure creativity and experimentation!

## What We're Aiming For üéØ

I believe we need a new way to communicate with LLMs. Adopting an intuitive graph structure can significantly enhance the organization and navigation of chat histories. This approach makes handling complex conversations simpler, allowing multiple lines of dialogue to branch out naturally and then be neatly summarized into single, cohesive nodes. Ultimately, this supports more natural, free-flowing, and multi-directional conversations, making interactions feel more genuine and enjoyable.
